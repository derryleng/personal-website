    I am a data analyst with experience applying R, Python, SQL on data-driven
    projects within consulting firms, as well as a web developer with experience
    building web applications using technologies such as R Shiny, Django and
    frontend web frameworks such as React and Svelte. Having recently graduated
    with a Master's degree in Global Finance Analytics, I am looking to apply my
    skills at the intersection between technology and finance.
